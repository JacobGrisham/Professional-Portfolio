  <p>During the span of my career as an environmental scientist, I've consciously developed five traits: effectively communicating with a diverse audience, working cohesively in a team, analyzing data, learning new material constantly, and solving problems. However, during my career, something important was missing from my day to day work-life... Building. With software engineering, I get to enjoy building <em>and</em> use all the strengths I've developed over the years. With an empathetic communication style, I can converse with non-technical colleagues. With refined collaboration skills, I can work cohesively across the software development lifecycle team. With quick analytical skills, I can deliver results under tight deadlines while maintaining attention to detail and thoroughness. With systematic problem solving, I can debug code and resolve technical errors.</p>

  <p>Since this is not LinkedIn, I wanted to share the journey in a more personal manner. While my jobs, or even career, don't define me, the journey has. This is my story, from the environmental field to the tech industry, a career change almost 5 years in the making.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of 2016, while working as a seasonal research associate, I knew something wasn't quite right. I enjoyed the subject matter of what I was working on, but the career potential was like trying to grow a tree in the narrow crack of concrete, and the novelty of living nomadically began to wear off. I began the search for something else, reading broadly and experimenting. Two of the most notable paths that I set my sights on were tech and healthcare. At the beginning of 2017, I explored data science with R and I continued with SQL into the summer.</p>

  <p>At the end of the summer of 2017, I worked as a seasonal field-based Research Associate Lead in eastern Oregon. But two events changed everything that summer. The first event started out innocuous. While in the remote wilderness of Oregon, my team and I stumbled across locals at our campsite. They quickly grew hostile, took out their guns for target practice, and made clear, but subtle hints as to their intentions if we didn't leave. We left immediately and once we made it back to town, called the sheriff. They got away. The second event quickly followed the first. Once I had my time off, I had to escape, choosing to go to Portland Oregon. During my vacation, I got involved in a biking accident, and I injured my left knee and went to the E.R. I was in intense pain and on crutches for weeks. I drove back home. That's when my anxiety over my indirection really set in. I couldn't bring myself to go back to the environmental field, but I didn't know where else to go. I came out of that dark time, and towards the end of 2017, I explored becoming a Physician Assistant. I experimented during this time by getting training and certifications to become an Emergency Medical Technician. I later realized that this wasn't the path for me.</p>

  <p>After giving the environmental field one last try by accepting an offer as a full-time Environmental Scientist in the Bay Area, I embarked on my self-taught journey in 2019. For two years, I burned the candle on both ends learning software engineering, building projects, and interviewing with recruiters. But I was happy to put in the work because I found a promising career path where I enjoyed the work itself. I was like a kid playing with LEGOs by building cool stuff. I was like a kid playing video games by leveling up certain skills within a skill tree (javascript to React.js). It was still hard work though and many times around 1:00 a.m., my doubts would start to creep in. And it took a lot of grit, especially after the rejections, one after another, I had to remain stoically enthusiastic (oxymoron). This part of the journey itself changed me in so many ways.</p>

  <p>If you made it down here, thank you for your patience and interest. It's been such a long, winding journey and I wanted to mark this milestone with a reflection of how I got here.</p>
